Title: Parse Parameters Inside a Docker Container
Version: 0.4.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Alexander", "Dolich", email = "alexander.dolich@kit.edu", role = c("cre","aut")),

Description: The functions get_parameters() and get_data() are intended to be used within a docker container with a certain file structure to read keyword arguments from the file /in/input.json automagically. The file /src/tool.yaml contains specifications on these keyword arguments, which are then passed as input to containerized R tools in the tool-runner framework.. A template for a containerized R tool, which can be used as a basis for developing new tools, is available at the following URL: <https://github.com/VForWaTer/tool_template_r>.
